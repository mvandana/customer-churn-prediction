ðŸ“‰ **Customer Churn Prediction**

**Summary**

Customer churn isnâ€™t just a KPI, itâ€™s a silent revenue killer. In this project, I built a fully functional churn prediction engine using telecom customer data. The model identifies high-risk users based on tenure, billing behavior, and contract preferences â€” arming teams with actionable insights to reduce churn.

The model is interpretable, fast to deploy, and delivers real-time churn probabilities for any new customer, making it ideal for integration into CRM systems or retention dashboards.

**My Approach**

1. Data Cleaning & Transformation
â€¢	Converted TotalCharges to numeric and handled missing values.
â€¢	Dropped irrelevant columns.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
â€¢	Visualized churn distribution to understand class imbalance.
â€¢	Used a heatmap to explore correlations between tenure, charges, and churn.

3. Feature Engineering
â€¢	Label-encoded binary columns (e.g., gender, Partner, Churn).
â€¢	One-hot encoded multi-class columns like Contract, InternetService, and PaymentMethod.
â€¢	Scaled numerical features (tenure, MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges) for model stability.

4. Modeling
â€¢	Trained a Decision Tree Classifier with max_depth=6 to balance performance and interpretability.

5. Evaluation & Diagnostics
â€¢	Assessed performance using classification report (precision, recall, F1-score).
â€¢	Visualized the confusion matrix to analyze prediction accuracy.
â€¢	Plotted feature importances to identify top churn drivers.

6. Prediction Logic
â€¢	Built a pipeline to input new customer data, align features, scale values, and predict churn probability.
â€¢	Example: A customer with high monthly charges and a month-to-month contract had a 61% churn risk.

**Business Impact**

This model is more than just predictive, itâ€™s prescriptive. Hereâ€™s what it enables:

â€¢	Proactive Retention: Identify customers likely to churn before they actually do, and deploy tailored retention offers.
â€¢	Prioritized Interventions: Focus outreach on customers with high churn probability, optimizing resource allocation.
â€¢	Explainable Decisions: Tree-based model provides visibility into why a customer is flagged, useful for support teams.

Even a 5% reduction in churn can significantly boost recurring revenue, and this project gives teams the data muscle to make that happen.
